# üßæ Querying a Data Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric

This repository documents the completion of a hands-on lab focused on **querying and validating data in a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse** using T-SQL.

## üéØ Purpose of the Lab

The objective of this lab was to explore how Microsoft Fabric enables **relational data exploration, analysis, and data quality validation** through its integrated data warehouse environment. With built-in SQL capabilities and seamless integration with Power BI through DirectLake, Fabric offers a unified experience for large-scale analytics.

## üß† What I Learned

Throughout this lab, I gained hands-on experience with the following concepts:

- **Creating a Sample Data Warehouse**  
  Set up a sample warehouse with pre-loaded data in a taxi ride analysis scenario, ready for querying and modeling.

- **Exploring Tables with T-SQL**  
  Wrote SQL queries to analyze trip data by time and location, using joins, groupings, and aggregations.

- **Using IntelliSense and Code Features**  
  Experienced the benefits of Fabric‚Äôs SQL editor features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and result previews.

- **Data Quality Checks**  
  Practiced verifying and cleaning inconsistent records ‚Äî such as identifying trips with negative or excessively long durations ‚Äî and removing or flagging them for better data integrity.

- **Creating Views for Reusability**  
  Converted filtered SQL queries into reusable **views**, enabling clean, consistent access to data for reporting and analysis teams.

- **Understanding Semantic Consistency**  
  Learned how to ensure analytical consistency by creating focused subsets of data that align with business reporting needs.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

At the end of this lab, I built a clear understanding of how to:
- Query a Fabric data warehouse with SQL
- Perform data validations and cleanup
- Create views to streamline data access
- Use the graphical interface for navigating schemas and verifying results

This lab reinforced how Microsoft Fabric supports both **ad-hoc exploration** and **structured modeling**, making it a robust platform for modern data analytics.
